# Jarvis

Jarvis is an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) alternative for Windows 10.

Jarvis is currently under development, and all features are not there yet. Pull requests are currently only accepted for things like performance/memory optimizations and bugs at the moment until everything's more stable. If there's a feature that you would like to see in Jarvis, then please submit an [issue](https://github.com/spectresystems/jarvis/issues).

Jarvis is designed to not require elevated user privileges at any time, and will only index things available in the current user's scope. Indexed data is never transmitted over the internet.

## Installation and usage

You can install Jarvis from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/spectresystems/jarvis/releases). 

After it is installed, press `alt`+`space` and type in your query. To search files and programs, just start typing. To search Wikipedia type `wiki` before the query. To search Google type `g` and then the query.

## Features

* Search for installed Win32 and UWP applications.
* Search for user documents.
* Search on Google.
* Search on Wikipedia.

## Requirements

Jarvis is designed to run on Windows 10. If it works on earlier versions of Windows then it's great, but there will be no effort made to officially support other versions than Windows 10.
